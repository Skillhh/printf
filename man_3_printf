.PP
Flags & Description 
.PP
[-] Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default (see width sub-specifier).
[+] Forces to precede the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a -ve sign.
[(space)] If no sign is going to be written, a blank space is inserted before the value.
[#] Used with o, x or X specifiers the value is preceded with 0, 0x or 0X respectively for values different than zero. Used with e, E and f, it forces the written output to contain a decimal point even if no digits would follow. By default, if no digits follow, no decimal point is written. Used with g or G the result is the same as with e or E but trailing zeros are not removed.
[0] Left-pads the number with zeroes (0) instead of spaces, where padding is specified (see width sub-specifier).
